#### Part A. What I learned from reading the original README.md

###### From reading the README, I learned that READMEs have been an essential part of software documentation since at least the 1970s, originating from the PDP-10 era and possibly even earlier with paper notes on punchcard stacks. The article emphasizes that a high-quality README should effectively communicate what a module does, show it in action, explain how to use it, and provide any other relevant details, all while maintaining brevity. Most importantly, I learned about the concept of "cognitive funneling" which is a process of structuring README content from broad, pertinent details at the top to more specific details further down, allowing readers to quickly determine if the module meets their needs without having to read the entire document.
